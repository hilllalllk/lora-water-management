## Tables

| Table | Contents | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `devices` | Nodes and their latest state | Admin (insert), gateway (heartbeat), trigger (latest reading) |
| `telemetry` | Measurement history | Gateway only |
| `commands` | Command queue and status | Operator/admin (inserts `pending`), gateway (updates status) |
| `gateways` | Gateway health | Gateway only |
| `profiles` | One row per user: `full_name`, `role` | Trigger on `auth.users` (insert), admin (role), user (own `full_name`) |
| `alerts` | Alarm events, open while `resolved_at` is null | Triggers / `check_offline_devices()` only |
| `push_tokens` | Expo push tokens of users' phones | Each user, own rows only |

## Roles

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| `admin` (Yönetici) | Everything below, plus change users' roles and device alarm thresholds |
| `operator` (Operatör) | Send commands |
| `viewer` (İzleyici) | Read only (default for new users) |

The role lives in `public.profiles.role`; policies use `public.has_role('operator', 'admin')`. The gateway is separate: it is identified by `app_metadata.role = 'gateway'` (`public.is_gateway()`), has no app role and cannot send commands.

The first admin must be set from the SQL Editor (after the user exists in Authentication > Users):

```sql
update public.profiles set role = 'admin'
 where id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'you@example.com');
```

After that, admins manage roles from the app's "Kullanıcılar" screen. The last admin cannot be demoted.

## Alarm thresholds and alerts

`devices` has nullable thresholds `level_low_mm`, `level_high_mm`, `pressure_low_cbar`, `pressure_high_cbar` and `offline_after_s` (default 600). Null disables that check. Only admins can change them; admins cannot change the device state columns written by the gateway.

- Every telemetry insert is checked (`telemetry_alerts` trigger). When a condition starts an alert is opened (at most one open alert per device and kind); when the value is back to normal it is resolved. A non-zero `alarms` bitmask opens a `device_alarm` alert.
- `public.check_offline_devices()` opens `offline` alerts for devices silent longer than `offline_after_s`. The migration schedules it every minute with pg_cron when the extension is available (it is on Supabase; check Database > Cron). The alert is resolved as soon as the device is heard again (telemetry or gateway heartbeat).
- `alerts` is in the Realtime publication, so the app updates live.


The gateway is an ESP32 on Wi-Fi. It signs in as the gateway user and polls pending `commands` over the REST API every 1-2 s.

Setup: [docs/05-kurulum.md §1](../docs/05-kurulum.md#1-supabase-projesi). Design: [docs/02 §6](../docs/02-sistem-mimarisi.md#6-supabase-veri-modeli).

## Push notifications

New alerts are pushed to phones by the Edge Function `send-alert-push`, triggered by a Database Webhook.

1. Deploy the function (Supabase CLI, from `backend/`):

   ```bash
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
   supabase functions deploy send-alert-push --no-verify-jwt
   ```

   `--no-verify-jwt` lets the webhook call it without a user JWT; protect it with the secret below. (Alternatively keep JWT verification and let the webhook send the service role key as `Authorization: Bearer ...`.)

2. Set the secrets (`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are already provided to Edge Functions):

   ```bash
   supabase secrets set WEBHOOK_SECRET=<long random string>
   # only if you enabled "enhanced push security" for the Expo project:
   supabase secrets set EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=<expo access token>
   ```

3. Create the webhook in the dashboard: Database > Webhooks > Create a new hook
   - Table: `public.alerts`, Events: **Insert**
   - Type: Supabase Edge Functions, function `send-alert-push`, method POST
   - HTTP headers: add `x-webhook-secret: <same value as WEBHOOK_SECRET>`

The function reads all `push_tokens` with the service role, sends to the Expo push API in chunks of 100 (title `Alarm: <device name>`, body = alert message) and deletes tokens Expo reports as `DeviceNotRegistered`. The app registers its token with `public.register_push_token()` after sign-in (see `mobile/README.md`).

## Tests

```bash
# Against a local PostgreSQL (PGHOST, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD must be set)
bash backend/supabase/tests/run.sh
```

`run.sh` creates a fresh database per test file, applies the stub and all migrations in order, then runs the test. pg_cron is not needed locally (the migration skips the schedule with a notice).

If you change the schema, add a new migration file (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`) and add tests to a test file listed in `run.sh`.
